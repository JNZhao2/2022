 <h3>Mushroom Classification Project</h3><br>
 The goal of this project is to find a model that could classify edible mushrooms from the poisonous ones by their physical characteristics. Mushroom poisoning is still one of the serious safety issues that cause statistics of major harm or fatalities each year, so to develop a model with precise predictions will be beneficial to the whole society. <br>
 <h4>Description</h4>
 The database we used is focused on gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family, and we found that no single factors could be used to determine the edibility of the mushroom alone. Among the models we used, the k-NN model, the logistic regression model, and the random forest model all perform well in predicting. In real-world studies, it is possible that there will be an asymmetric cost structure, for example, the cost of misclassifying a poisonous mushroom as edible may be more than the cost of misclassifying an edible mushroom as poison, and the model performance could be reevaluated based on that.<br>
